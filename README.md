# Finding_faulty_temperature_sensor_in_process_plant
Finding a faulty temperature sensor in a process plant using data reconciliation

Key steps:
1. Data preprocessing by removing outliers
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - Plot Mass flow rate and Temperatue data as time-series
3. Find mean and standard deviations of temperature reading errors using Energy balance calculations
4. Finding the temperature sensor with gross errors
